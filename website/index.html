There are many reasons as to why somebody may start smoking, however, there are some more common reasons. For instance, a typical reason for somebody to start smoking is due to peer pressure by their friends, as they dont want to feel isolated from the group or an outcast. People may also have begun smoking tobacco due to it being easier to manage social standings as they consider it to make them feel more "relaxed". However, many smokers in today's society are people in their adulthood and mainly</p><p> later-adulthood. This is as a result of it being normal during when they were growing up, and some of the people in their< later-adulthood may have even been told that by smoking cigarrettes it brings you many health benefits!
